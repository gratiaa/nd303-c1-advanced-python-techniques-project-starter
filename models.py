"""Represent models for near-Earth objects and their close approaches.

The `NearEarthObject` class represents a near-Earth object. Each has a
unique primary designation, an optional unique name, an optional
diameter, and a flag for whether the object is potentially hazardous.
The `CloseApproach` class represents a close approach to Earth by an
NEO. Each has an approach datetime, a nominal approach distance, and a
relative approach velocity.  A `NearEarthObject` maintains a collection
of its close approaches, and a `CloseApproach` maintains a reference to
its NEO.  The functions that construct these objects use information
extracted from the data files from NASA, so these objects should be able
to handle all of the quirks of the data set, such as missing names and
unknown diameters.  You'll edit this file in Task 1.
